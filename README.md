C64.CH  - The relaunch


![.NET Build](https://github.com/Sabbi/C64.CH/workflows/.NET%20Core/badge.svg)

This it the official source repository of [C64.CH](https://www.c64.ch), a portal dedicated to C64-Demos and the C64-Demoscene.

The site runs on .NET 8.0 / Blazor (Serverside) on Linux, with MySQL as the database. More details here: [C64.CH Technical Information](https://www.c64.ch/help/technical).

For more information please check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/Sabbi/C64.CH/wiki).

**Please note**:
This is a one person hobbyist project, created in spare time. While hopefully doing its job, the published code does - in most parts - not follow best practices or common conventions. Use at your own responsibility.
